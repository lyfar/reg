# Forgot Password Link

The forgot password link is placed below the login form on the login screen. Its purpose is to redirect users to the main ZFX portal when they need to reset their password.

<Steps>
### Step 1

When a user clicks on the forgot password link, they will be redirected to the password recovery page on the main ZFX portal (e.g., my.zfx.com or any other relevant domain for the user).

### Step 2

The user will follow the password recovery process on the main portal, which may involve entering their registered email address or phone number and receiving a password reset link or temporary password.

### Step 3

After successfully resetting their password on the main portal, the user can return to the [login screen](/login-screen) and log in using their new password.

<Callout type="info">
The forgot password link should be clearly visible and easily accessible on the login screen. Consider using a contrasting color or underlining the link to make it stand out from other elements on the page.

## Link Destination

The destination URL for the forgot password link should be dynamically generated based on the user's associated domain. For example:

- If the user is associated with my.zfx.com, the link should point to https://my.zfx.com/forgot-password
- If the user is associated with another domain (e.g., zfx.cn), the link should point to the corresponding forgot password page on that domain (e.g., https://zfx.cn/forgot-password)

## Error Handling

If the main portal is unavailable or the forgot password link is broken, the app should display an appropriate error message to the user. The error message should be clear, concise, and provide guidance on what the user can do to resolve the issue (e.g., contacting customer support).

By providing a seamless forgot password experience, users can easily recover their accounts and regain access to the ZFX trading PWA without any hassle.
