# Registration Link

The registration link on the login screen is designed to redirect users to the main ZFX trading platform for creating a new account. As the PWA currently does not support the registration process within the app, this link serves as a convenient way for new users to navigate to the appropriate registration page.

## Implementation

The registration link should be placed below the login button on the login screen. It should be clearly labeled as "Register" or "Create an Account" to indicate its purpose.

Here's an example of how the registration link can be implemented in HTML:

```html
<a href="https://my.zfx.com/register" class="register-link">Create an Account</a>
```

The `href` attribute should contain the URL of the registration page on the main ZFX trading platform. The exact URL may vary depending on the specific domain or region.

## User Flow

When a user clicks on the registration link, the following steps should occur:

<Steps>
### Step 1

The PWA should open the registration URL in a new tab or window of the user's default browser.

### Step 2

The user should be directed to the registration page on the main ZFX trading platform, where they can complete the account creation process.
</Steps>

By opening the registration page in a new tab or window, the user can easily navigate back to the PWA after completing the registration process.

## Future Considerations

In future releases of the ZFX trading PWA, it may be beneficial to incorporate the registration process directly within the app. This would provide a more seamless user experience and eliminate the need for redirecting users to the main platform for account creation.

To implement in-app registration, the following steps would be required:

1. Design and develop a user-friendly registration form within the PWA.
2. Implement client-side validation to ensure that user input meets the required criteria (e.g., password strength, email format).
3. Integrate with the backend API to securely transmit user registration data and create new accounts.
4. Handle success and error scenarios, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

By incorporating the registration process within the PWA, users can enjoy a more streamlined and convenient experience when starting their trading journey with ZFX.
