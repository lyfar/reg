# Login Form

The login form is a crucial component of the ZFX trading PWA, allowing users to access their accounts using either their phone number or email address. The form consists of two tabs: one for phone number login and another for email login.

## Phone Number Tab

By default, the phone tab is selected when the user lands on the login screen. The phone input field should have the following features:

- Country code selector with a flag icon
- Users can change the country code by clicking on the flag icon and selecting from a list of countries
- Users cannot modify the country code directly
- Input mask to ensure proper phone number formatting
- Only numeric input is allowed

<Callout type="info">
Ensure that the phone number input follows the E.164 international standard format for consistency and easier backend processing.
</Callout>

## Email Tab

Users can switch to the email tab to log in using their registered email address. The email input field should:

- Validate the email format using a regular expression or built-in HTML5 email validation
- Display an error message if the entered email is invalid

## Password Input

Below the phone number or email input, there is a password field. The password input should have the following features:

- Password masking by default
- Toggle to show/hide the password in plain text
- No specific password requirements (e.g., minimum length or character types) as the accounts are pre-existing

## Form Validation and Error Handling

Proper form validation and error handling are essential for a smooth user experience. Implement the following:

- Real-time validation for phone number and email formats
- Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs, such as:
  - "Invalid phone number"
  - "Invalid email address"
  - "Incorrect password"
  - "Account doesn't exist"

<Steps>
### Step 1

Validate the phone number or email format when the user finishes typing or moves to the next input field.

### Step 2

If the input is invalid, display the corresponding error message below the input field.

### Step 3

If the input is valid, remove any previously displayed error messages.

### Step 4

When the user clicks the login button, validate all fields and display error messages if necessary.

</Steps>

By implementing these validation and error handling steps, users will receive immediate feedback on their input and can correct any issues before attempting to log in.
