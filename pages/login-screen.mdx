# Login Screen

The login screen is the first interface users encounter when accessing the ZFX PWA. It serves as the gateway for users to authenticate and gain access to the trading platform. The login screen is designed to provide a seamless and user-friendly experience while ensuring the security of user credentials.

## Layout and Components

The login screen consists of the following main components:

1. **Install App Prompt**: A prompt at the top of the screen encouraging users to install the ZFX app on their home screen for easy access. The prompt includes an install link button that opens a drawer with instructions on how to add the app to the home screen.

2. **Headline and Subtitle**: The headline "Login" clearly indicates the purpose of the screen, while the subtitle "Start your trading journey" serves as a call to action for users.

3. **Language Switcher**: Located on the right side of the title and subtitle, the language switcher allows users to select their preferred language. It displays a flag icon with a dropdown arrow, and clicking it opens a drawer where users can choose from the available languages.

4. **Login Form**: The login form consists of two tabs: phone number and email. Users can log in using either their phone number or email address. The phone tab is selected by default and includes an input field for the phone number with a country code. The email tab allows users to enter their email address. Both tabs include a password input field with the option to show or hide the password.

5. **Forgot Password Link**: Below the login form, there is a "Forgot Password" link that redirects users to the main portal (my.zfx.com or the appropriate domain) to recover their password.

6. **Login Button**: The login button allows users to submit their credentials and log in to the application.

7. **Registration Link**: For users who don't have an account, a registration link is provided below the login button. Clicking this link redirects users to the main platform for registration.

The login screen is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent experience across all platforms.

## Subsections

The login screen consists of several subsections that provide specific functionalities:

- [Install App Prompt](/login-screen/install-app-prompt)
